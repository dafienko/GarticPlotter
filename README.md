# GarticPlotter
GarticPlotter has a few main commands. The first of note are 'tl' and 'br'. They stand for 'topleft' and 'bottomright' respectively. They define where the game is on your screen. Set those commands by putting your mouse over each corner and running the command.

Now, to plot images, you need to make sure the image you want to draw is in a folder named 'assets' in the working directory. Then, type 'image filename.extension'. It will batch draw a bunch of lines, surrender your mouse, and if you wish to continue or cancel you may do either.
